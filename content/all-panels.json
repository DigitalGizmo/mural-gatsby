                    "narrative": "<p>In pre-industrial America, skilled craftsmen used hand tools to create shoes, furniture, household goods, and other products. These highly skilled workers referred to themselves as &ldquo;mechanics&rdquo; or &ldquo;artisans.&rdquo; They worked in a three-tiered system consisting of the master craftsmen, journeyman who worked for wages, and apprentices in training. Only boys trained as apprentices. Women were not encouraged to work outside the home or farm.</p><p>In the 1700s and early 1800s, young men trained under master craftsmen to learn their trade. Parents often required a son to work under a master, so the boy would learn the skills needed to support a family and perhaps own his own shop. Parents signed an indenture (a legal contract) stating that in return for a young man&rsquo;s work, the master craftsman would provide a room, food, clothing, and an education for a set number of years. This apprentice system served as a secondary education for boys between 10 and 21, and they worked under contract for three to seven years. Because he was indentured, an apprentice was not allowed to leave his master&rsquo;s service before the agreed upon time. Sometimes apprentices ran away from their master, citing ill-treatment.</p><p>The master craftsman owned the shop and had the most experience in his craft. He waited on the customers, hired skilled craftsmen and planned the work. After an apprentice completed his training, the master often promoted him to journeyman. A journeyman was a skilled artisan who worked for wages. Once a journeyman saved enough money, he might become a master craftsman or &ldquo;mechanic&rdquo; with his own shop. This system of labor changed, at varying rates, over time and across regions, but became increasingly uncommon as industrialization changed the nature of most labor in the 1800s and 1900s. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/apprenticeship/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

                    "narrative": "<p>The panel&rsquo;s foreground depicts a shoemaker and his apprentice. The shoemaking industry provides an example of changes in production of consumer goods over time. At first, on farms and in rural frontier conditions, families wore home-made shoes. As towns grew, artisans set up shop often in their home and contracted with apprentices. Individuals placed custom orders called &quot;bespoke work,&quot; meaning to order in advance. In this system, the shoemaker&rsquo;s personal reputation depended on the quality of his work and determined his business success.</p><p>In the early 1800s, skilled urban craftsmen, or &quot;mechanics,&quot; began &quot;sale work.&quot; They made shoes to sell from their shops&rsquo; shelves, from a peddler&rsquo;s wagon, and later via railroad shipments in stores far from the shoemakers&rsquo; shop. To keep up with these new market demands, owners reorganized work. Craftsmen introduced efficiencies to speed production, including piece work and new technologies. Machines intensified a division of labor where a worker only made parts of a final product. The relationship between the craftsman and his work became less a matter of pride and more a matter of production goals. Quantity and not quality became critical in turning a profit.</p><p>As technology changed, the &quot;mystery&quot; or trade secrets imparted from master to apprentice became lost or irrelevant. Until the Civil War, most workers continued to be employed in small shops, but the structure of work steadily changed. With the uncertainty of distant markets and the need for flexible production, masters no longer wanted to commit to employing, feeding, and housing apprentices for years at a time. They preferred to hire workers as orders demanded. While shop workers at all levels once held shared interests, conflicts emerged between the master and his journeymen and apprentices over hourly pay, time, and working conditions. Remnants of the apprentice system exist today in certain trade unions, such as plumbing and electrical, in which the apprentice and journeymen titles are still used.</p>",

                    "narrative": "<p>Americans&rsquo; ideas about childhood have changed dramatically over the last 300 years. In the 1700s, children were viewed as little adults. Except in the wealthiest families, as soon as children were able to walk and take instruction, parents put them to work to maintain the family&apos;s home-based and farm economy. As America industrialized, more workers left the farm and home workshops for centralized &quot;manufactories.&quot; With children entering the workplace, a family&rsquo;s economic reliance on child labor became more visible, even though more children continued to work on family farms than enter industry.</p><p>Beginning in the 1790s, children held specific responsibilities in the first American factories. Owners valued children for their small, quick hands. For instance, they worked as doffers, exchanging full spools of thread for empty ones in spinning mills. Children as young as five years old worked for a fraction of the wages of an adult. Thus, child labor enabled employers to get the most work for the least money. Children laboring in factories cut short their education, risked health and safety, and missed opportunities to train as apprentices in skills that would allow them to advance themselves later in life.</p><p>Society considered children working alongside adults normal and necessary when families needed their children&rsquo;s income. Families unable to support their needs on the meager wages of one or two parents had few choices other than to send their young children to work in the factories. As the middle class expanded through the 1800s, however, the differences between children in working and middle class families became increasingly apparent. Reformers set to work to improve the lives of poor children. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/child-labor/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

The fish canneries were located along the Maine coast and drew workers from surrounding towns. August launched the busy season. Boats loaded with herring arrived early each morning. Work in the busy season extended from dawn to well into the night. In 1907, Maine&rsquo;s Department of Labor reported that children could come and go from the work place as they wished, but many children worked long hours. While workers received decent wages, their income depended on &quot;the catch.&quot; The more fish, the more work. Companies paid workers by the piece, whether that meant gutting an endless pile of fish to fill a box or packing a can of processed sardines.</p>",

Thousands of young Maine women left their family farms to work in textile mills. They first flocked to Lowell, Massachusetts, and later to mills throughout Maine. While millwork was monotonous, unhealthy, and often uncomfortable, it meant a certain freedom for young women leaving the farm.</p><p>In the 1820s, the first large textile factories equipped with power looms opened in Lowell, Massachusetts. Within ten years, Massachusetts&rsquo; textile mills employed as many as 5,000 young women from Maine. In the 1830s and 1840s, Maine&rsquo;s first large textile mills in Saco, Biddeford, Augusta, and Hallowell drew thousands more. By 1850, Lewiston and Auburn emerged as the &quot;spindle&quot; center of the state. Before the Civil War, most textile workers were unmarried girls and women ages 10 to middle age. Most expected to work only a few years before they married. Their wages brought them new economic freedoms, while helping their families back home. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/women-textiles/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

Limited ventilation caused many to develop brown lung disease (byssinosis) from extended periods of breathing cotton fibers. In this panel, the workers holding handkerchiefs represent those sickened by working conditions.</p><p>By 1850, mill owners began cutting wages and speeding production. In response, many of New England&rsquo;s &quot;mill girls&quot; moved into other occupations or back home. Over time, an influx of immigrants, largely Irish and French Canadian, replaced them in the mills. Often uneducated and poor, these new arrivals agreed to work long hours for low wages at a fast pace. Through the end of the 1800s, mill workers lived and labored in increasingly desperate conditions.</p>",

Free from their bosses&rsquo; watchful eyes, workers were able to vote in their own interests, rather than as their employer might wish.</p><p>In America&rsquo;s first decades, only white men who owned property could vote. The United States Constitution allowed each state to make its own voting laws. By 1830, most states eliminated the property owning requirement and gave most white men the vote. Initially, a voter cast his vote by voice or by visibly placing a stone or marble in a container to indicate his vote, forcing him to publicly declare his choice.</p><p>As America&rsquo;s population grew, paper ballots emerged as the most convenient voting method. Though paper ballots were easiest to tally, they were not secret ballots. Voters wrote down their candidates of choice and openly handed their ballots to election officials. If a voter misspelled a candidate&rsquo;s name or office, his ballot would be cast out.</p><p>Paper ballots proved difficult for uneducated voters who couldn&rsquo;t write names on their ballots. To remedy this, political parties pre-printed ballots with their candidates&rsquo; names. Because these &quot;party tickets&quot; were different sizes and colors, observers could easily determine how men voted. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/secret-ballot/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

The new owners often lacked connections to local workers. They ignored workers&apos; complaints of low wages and irregular paychecks. In 1877 workers formed ten local affiliates of the Granite Cutter&apos;s Union. Quarry owners responded by forming the Granite Manufacturers Association of New England which blacklisted workers who showed interest in unionizing. If a worker&apos;s name appeared on a &quot;blacklist&quot; the owners agreed no one would hire him.</p><p><br></p>",

As populations grew and transportation took merchandise to ever-wider markets, production accelerated. By the mid-1800s, the pre-industrial artisan system of independent shop owners gave way to dependent factory wage workers who mass-produced goods. This change in production drained workers&rsquo; pride in their craft and deteriorated conditions in their workplaces. Labor unions and mechanics&apos; associations formed to support workers through these changes and advocate for improved working conditions.</p><p>Highly skilled artisans, known as mechanics, first banded together to elevate their members through education and to foster mutual support in times of sickness or economic distress. The Maine Charitable Mechanic Association began in Portland in 1815. The Bangor Mechanic Association was organized in 1828. Among their organizational activities, these groups paraded the city streets to promote their skills and underscore that their leadership made them important cornerstones in their communities.</p><p>In 1882, the Knights of Labor was the first major national union to come to Maine. The Knights sought to uplift humanity through reform. The Knights advocated for the abolition of child labor, an eight-hour work day, equal pay for equal work, and a graduated income tax, in which those with higher incomes paid higher taxes. Despite opposition from business owners, politicians, and the Catholic Church (of which many immigrant workers were members), the Knights of Labor claimed 27,900 Maine workers in 127 local assemblies in 1887. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/labor-day/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

The following year, the Knights organized a state-wide effort when several cities declared a municipal holiday, and many shops and factories closed for the day. &nbsp;</p>",

Lumber was necessary for shipbuilding, construction, and making the barrels and boxes in which most merchandise was transported until the 1900s. One key to Maine&rsquo;s early lumbering success was an expansive and interconnected system of lakes, streams, and rivers rushing to the Atlantic. Floating logs down the rivers to mills and transporting milled lumber by ship was significantly cheaper than transporting wood products overland, giving Maine an economic edge.</p><p>After the Civil War, railroads dominated transportation. This drove western expansion, lowered the demand for ships, and increased the cost of shipping lumber from Maine. As the American population center moved west, so did the demand for lumber. Midwestern and Western tree stands drew many experienced Maine loggers seeking better wages and new opportunities. To compete with western markets, Maine&rsquo;s lumber industry diversified its products. Turning away from board lumber for construction, lumbermen worked for companies formed to process wood to meet growing demands for paper. By the 1890s, much of Maine&rsquo;s lumber went to pulp and paper mills. Maine reached its peak lumbering years between 1890 and 1910 as crews cut further north into the Maine forest to supply these new mills. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/logging/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

                    "narrative": "<p>This panel foreground depicts a conversation among loggers and members of the Industrial Workers of the World, a union that attempted to organize Maine&rsquo;s woodsmen.</p><p>Life and working conditions in lumber camps were difficult. Lumbermen set up camp in the late fall. The bulk of the work was accomplished in the frigid winter months when it was easier to move trees through the forest on snow-covered ground. Crews of up to fifty men cut logs and loaded them on sleds drawn by oxen (later by horses and steam or gas-powered Lombard log haulers). The sleds carried the logs to the edges of streams where workers stacked them, waiting for spring river swells to carry the logs to lumber mills downstream.</p><p>Before the Civil War most lumbermen came from rural Maine and often worked alongside people they knew. As many seasoned loggers followed the lumber business west, Maine&rsquo;s lumber operators began using recruiting services in Quebec, New Brunswick, Bangor, Portland, and Boston. Agents solicited men, often immigrants, many of whom had never been in the woods. Recruiters frequently misrepresented the work and living circumstances to potential loggers. For example, recruits who had agreed to work in a lumber mill instead found themselves aboard a train going to a camp deep in the woods where they had to stay and work for as long as five months. They often arrived penniless and needed to be outfitted by the company store. The company took money from the men&rsquo;s pay to settle such debts, often leaving workers with barely any pay at all.</p><p>Sometimes disgruntled loggers abandoned camp. In response, the Maine legislature passed a bill in 1907 making it a crime to leave one&rsquo;s place of work while owing money to the company store. Critics called this a &quot;peonage&quot; act, after the degrading term &quot;peon.&quot; This act forced workers to stay on the job or face jail time; by 1915, hundreds had been convicted under it.</p><p>In 1924, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) first attempted to organize the 15,000 men in Maine&rsquo;s lumber and timber industry. The IWW had been operating in Maine since 1906, but no union had been successful with woods workers. The workforce came from many cultural backgrounds and changed camps each season, which made organizing them especially difficult. Although the IWW never achieved its organizing goals for woodsmen, the union succeeded in improving living conditions in the camps and establishing an eight-hour work day at a time when the typical work day might last up to 14 hours. The IWW met resistance, including jail time for IWW leaders, for their efforts in bringing loggers to the union.</p>",

The leadership and members of the locally based union, the Lewiston-Auburn Shoeworkers Protective Association (LASPA), were largely English-speaking, with personal connections to local authorities and businessmen. These local ties softened the LASPA members&apos; stance. This, along with its lack of funds and organizing experience, contributed to the LASPA&apos;s inability to successfully negotiate with the local factory owners.</p>",

                    "narrative": "<p>During the Great Depression, shoe workers at 19 factories in Lewiston-Auburn grew tired of earning far less than their Massachusetts counterparts. In 1932, they defied a &quot;yellow-dog contract&quot; that their employers had forced them to sign stating they would never join a union. The workers formed a local union and went on strike. In response, the owners banded together as members of the Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Manufacturers Association (LASMA) and quickly crushed the local union.</p><p>Without resolution to their grievances, in 1937 a group of shoe workers requested help from the United Shoe Workers of America, an affiliate of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The CIO sent two organizers up from Massachusetts who held weekly meetings of over 1000 people. A CIO representative sent a letter to the LASMA demanding that the factory owners negotiate with the union on behalf of the workers and that the manufacturers agree to a 15% wage increase, a 40 hour work week, and union recognition.</p><p>The owners refused to negotiate with the CIO, arguing the union&rsquo;s representatives were outside agitators who did not represent Maine workers. LASMA offered a 10% incremental raise. With the manufacturers&rsquo; refusal to talk with union representatives, organizers called a mass meeting at Lewiston City Hall that drew 3,000 people. The CIO called for a vote to strike. The informal voice vote produced &quot;yes&quot; cheers that drowned out the few dissenting voices. Lacking a documented, unanimous response, the manufacturers questioned the vote&rsquo;s legitimacy. Nevertheless, thousands of workers walked off the job for 94 days, bringing shoe making to a temporary standstill in the cities. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/shoe-strike/fore/\">More...</a>&nbsp;</p>",

He also ruled that anyone picketing or attending a meeting could be arrested.</p><p>The following day, 1,000 workers marched across the bridge from Lewiston to Auburn. This panel depicts the mass demonstration, later known as &quot;Red Wednesday.&quot; When police grabbed a female worker, chaos erupted. Using tear gas and clubs, the police pushed the crowd back to Lewiston. Governor Lewis O. Barrows sent 400 National Guardsmen to join the Auburn and Maine State Police. Authorities arrested the CIO leaders, held them without bail, and sentenced them to six months in prison. The companies hired replacement workers or &quot;scabs.&quot;</p><p>The National Labor Relations Board, an agency newly formed by New Deal legislation to protect workers&rsquo; rights, sent a federal investigator to review the dispute. In his final report, the investigator found that although the CIO had made mistakes, the strike was legitimate. He ordered that official union elections should occur within twenty days and that only the workers employed before the strike could vote. He mandated that the manufacturers negotiate with the CIO. With this ruling, the CIO ordered the workers back to work. The owners refused to hire back most of the 2,000 striking workers, despite existing federal legislation known as the Wagner Act, which gave workers the right to organize and bargain collectively for the first time in U.S. history. In addition to many workers not getting their jobs back, several shoe companies closed, and the CIO was never officially recognized by Lewiston-Auburn shoe companies.</p>",

Industrialists, parents, and sometimes children, who did not want to go to school, resisted changes in child labor laws.

When the fire broke out, the factory&apos;s doors were locked and fire escapes inoperable, resulting in the deaths of 146 young women, children, and men in eighteen minutes.

                    "narrative": "<p>American reform movements grew out of religious efforts to improve society. Abolition and temperance, the most effective reform campaigns began in the middle 1800s. Abolitionists sought to end slavery, and temperance workers wanted to restrict or eliminate the drinking of liquor in the belief it would curtail domestic abuse and reduce poverty. As conditions worsened in America&rsquo;s factories after the Civil War, reformers turned to improving the lives of workers. They challenged dangerous working conditions, long hours, child labor, and the low pay that kept families living in squalor.</p><p>By 1900, reformers began to professionalize by using new tactics to advocate for reform. University programs in economics, statistics, sociology, and psychology trained experts who believed that by scientifically documenting social problems, they could develop workable solutions. At the same time, investigative reports filled America&rsquo;s rapidly expanding mass media. Stories in popular magazines described the lives of the less fortunate. These reports alerted middle class readers to the plight of the working classes. Once aware of the situation, many middle class men and women organized groups such as the National Consumer League which demanded that goods be made in factories whose owners maintained high standards of worker safety, reasonable hours, and pay. These groups striving to improve workers&rsquo; lives often shared goals with labor unions. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/reform/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

She agreed with the stipulation that she could pursue the policies on which she had long advocated, including a minimum wage, unemployment pay, an end to child labor, and establishing pensions.

Maine and the nation soon discovered an &quot;industrial reserve army&quot; as thousands of women moved from traditionally female jobs such as secretary, store clerk or textile worker to fill jobs. The federal government&rsquo;s Selective Service along with industry groups actively recruited women to take jobs that men exclusively held. In 1943, over 22,000 Maine women worked in war-related industries, crafting high-precision airplane parts, radio components, and ammunition. Women also drove hydraulic dump trucks and labored as shipbuilders and machinists. Women in these industrial jobs were hailed around the country as &ldquo;Rosie the Riveter&rdquo; and in Maine, &ldquo;Wendy the Welder.&rdquo; When the war ended, government, industry, and labor leaders pushed to get women back into the home. While some women happily returned to homemaking, others were reluctant to leave the high-paying jobs and the freedoms they afforded. The large number of women employed in war highlighted challenges to traditional ideas of what women could and should do. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/Rosie/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

In Maine they were sometimes called &quot;Wendy the Welder.&quot; Women worked in large numbers in Maine&rsquo;s shipyards; 3,700 worked in in South Portland to build thirty &quot;Ocean&quot; cargo ships for the British government and 236 &quot;Liberty&quot; cargo ships for the U.S. Over 1,600 women worked in In Bath to build eighty destroyers.</p><p>As women took on traditionally male jobs, they endured harassment from some of their co-workers, while other male co-workers spoke up on their behalf. Some female workers demanded &quot;equal pay for equal work,&quot; since the women had directly replaced men who had gone to war. Labor unions argued that by paying women less money, men&rsquo;s wages in the same jobs might erode after the war. Once the war ended, calls for equal pay for women lost momentum as returning servicemen sought jobs and industry leaders encouraged women to return to home-based work. While some women happily returned to homemaking, others were reluctant to leave these high paying jobs and the freedoms they afforded.</p>",

In response, on June 16, 1987, the United Paperworkers International Union (UPIU) went on strike. In Jay, Maine, UPIU&rsquo;s Local 14 and Local 246 of the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers boasted a membership of 1,250 workers. These workers left the Androscoggin mill to organize massive demonstrations that garnered national attention. Lasting 16 months, the strike was the longest running in New England history.</p><p>The strike tore the community apart. IP hired over 1,000 permanent replacement workers enabling the mill to run at almost full capacity. Individuals opposing the strike were ostracized. Some workers who crossed picket lines experienced violence. In the end, the parent union, UPIU, refused to expand the walk-out to include additional IP mills, and the company wouldn&rsquo;t budge. This loss of national union support caused the strike to collapse. Some strikers were hired back in the following years, but many lost their jobs permanently. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/panels/jay-strike/fore/\">More...</a></p>",

Although profits hit nearly record highs in the mid-1980s, the company feared international competition and had recently lost market share.</p>"

There is uncertainty, a little anxiety, and some hope in the faces of the new workers. What will their jobs be in the new Maine?</p><p>They probably won&rsquo;t need that sledgehammer. Manufacturing, mining, and forestry, once representing 40% of employment in Maine, are now down to about 9%. Today health care, government, and tourism and hospitality, to name just three employment sectors, account for almost 45% of Maine&rsquo;s workers.</p><p>The fastest growth today is in health care and social assistance, tourism and hospitality, professional services, transportation and utilities, construction, and educational services. We can&rsquo;t fully predict what employment in Maine will be like in 50 years, but some trends are clear: we are heading towards providing more human care and leisure services. Investments in education are necessary to support new ways of thinking and new technologies.</p><p><br></p>",

Technology has advanced, allowing twenty-five workers in a lumber mill to do what required a hundred workers a generation ago, and those traditional industries are shrinking because of larger changes in the economy.</p><p>Maine has the oldest median population of any US state, and many of its experienced workers are now retiring. The percentage of those of prime working age, 18-64, is creeping downward. In ten years it has dropped from about 64% to 61% as older workers have left the labor force.</p><p>In 2018, more people died than were born in Maine. But Maine&rsquo;s population still grew by a little, because enough people moved here to offset the losses. They moved here because Maine is one of the nicest places in the US to live and work in. We have some of our country&rsquo;s best natural environments, most affordable housing, and lowest crime; and we have jobs. To sustain ourselves and our beautiful state, support its livable cities, its outstanding small-town life, and its impressive institutions, we need more people to learn about us, and move here. The workforce of the future will be more diverse, better educated, and younger than today&rsquo;s. We must welcome them with open arms.</p>",
